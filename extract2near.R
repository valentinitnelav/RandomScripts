    # Function to extract the closest valid cell values from raster.
    # Specifically, for all points that the usual raster::extract() returns NA,
    # it searches for the closest non-NA cell value within given buffer (typically meters).
    # All other points returned by the usual raster::extract() are kept as such.
    # ___ Arguments
    # rst       - raster object
    # XY        - data.table with two columns: first column=longitude; second column=latitude
    # my.buffer - same as in raster::extract(); "The radius of a buffer around each point from which to extract cell values. [...]
    #             If the data are not projected (latitude/longitude), the unit should be meters. 
    #             Otherwise it should be in map-units (typically also meters)".
    #             buffer needs to be at least the raster's resolution (one cell)
    # ___ Returns
    # data.frame object with point ID-s, cell ID-s, cell values and raster values name (recycled)
